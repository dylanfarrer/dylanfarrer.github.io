        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about tackling real-world challenges in computing, with a particular focus on the design and optimization of distributed and scalable systems. My work lies at the intersection of systems architecture, networking, and storage.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Currently, I am conducting research in software-defined storage at <strong>Imperial College London</strong> under the supervision of <strong>Dr. Marios Kogias</strong>. Initially, my research investigates performance bottlenecks in datacentre-scale networked storage pipelines - specifically, the inefficiencies introduced by complex configuration parameters in software-defined storage systems.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            The goal of my work is to explore intelligent, adaptive techniques that mitigate these performance issues, making modern storage architectures more robust, predictable, and scalable.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Broadly, my interests span <strong>distributed systems</strong>, <strong>storage architectures</strong>, and <strong>systems performance engineering</strong>. I am driven by the challenge of building infrastructure that is both high-performance and practically deployable at scale.
